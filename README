
Dataset instructions
- Code for the paper "Understanding Self-Training for Gradual Domain Adaptation"
- The portraits dataset is an existing dataset, and can be downloaded from
https://www.dropbox.com/s/ubjjoo0b2wz4vgz/faces_aligned_small_mirrored_co_aligned_cropped_cleaned.tar.gz?dl=0
- After downloading, extract the tar file, and copy the "M" and "F" folders inside a folder called dataset_32x32 inside the
code folder (current folder, where the README is). Then run "python create_dataset.py"
- Create a folder called "saved_files" in the current code folder.
- Experiments on other datasets should work without downloading additional datasets.
- For the final camera-ready code, we will include virtualenv instructions, and a more automated process for processing the dataset.

Main files
- gradual_shift_better.py contains scripts for experiments in Section 5.1 and 5.3.
- regularization_helps.py contains scripts for experiments in Section 5.2.


CHANGELOG of CIS620:
- change code syntax and bug fix for tensorflow 2
- added experiments for different metrics in cover type experiment (horizontal distance to fire points and roadways)
- dataset available here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/covertype, extract covtype.data into a directory under the repo directory into data/covtype.data
- added experiment for rotmnist 90 and rotmnist 180
- added experiment for fashion mnist

To run the new experiments:

    Cover Type:
        Change the argument --experiment_name to cov_type_roadway for the roadway experiment

        Change the argument --experiment_name to cov_type_firepoint for the firepoint experiment

    rotMNIST 90/180
        Change the argument --experiment_name to rotating_mnist_180, and uncomment line 117-132 for rotmnist 90 mod,

        Change the argument --experiment_name to rotating_mnist_90, and uncomment line 117-132, and change new_num_intermediate to 134000 for rotmnist 180 mod
    
    Fashion MNIST:
        Change the argument --experiment_name to rotating_fashion_mnist_main for the fashion mnist experiment

To run dataset analysis: run cov_type_analysis.py
